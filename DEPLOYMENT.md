1. **Create GitHub Repository**
   - Go to GitHub.com and create a new repository
   - Name it something like `marleen-molenaar-catalogue`

2. **Upload Files**
   - Upload ALL files from this directory to your GitHub repository
   - Make sure to upload the `images` folder with all product photos
   - Ensure `index.html` is in the root directory

   - Scroll down to "Pages" section
   - Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Select "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
   - Click "Save"

4. **Access Your Catalogue**
   - GitHub will provide a URL like: `https://yourusername.github.io/marleen-molenaar-catalogue`
